                    <!-- <p><b>Chapter 4 — “The Spark of Determination”</b></p> -->

                    <p>After the disappointment of the competition,<br>
                    Aarav threw himself into studying with a seriousness he had never felt before.<br>
                    He was no longer studying just to pass exams —<br>
                    he was studying to prove something to himself.</p>

                    <p>Every morning before school,<br>
                    he sat outside his small house with a notebook in hand,<br>
                    revising chapters, solving sums,<br>
                    and repeating concepts until he understood them completely.</p>

                    <p>His parents watched quietly.<br>
                    They didn’t fully understand what had happened,<br>
                    but they could sense that something inside their son had changed.</p>

                    <p><b>Kavya’s Role</b></p>

                    <p>Kavya stood by him like a true companion.<br>
                    She prepared charts,<br>
                    organized notes,<br>
                    and even created small quizzes for him to practice.</p>

                    <p>Whenever Aarav made a mistake,<br>
                    she didn’t scold or laugh.<br>
                    She patiently explained the concept again —<br>
                    sometimes once, sometimes twice,<br>
                    sometimes until Aarav understood fully.</p>

                    <p>Often they sat under the banyan tree,<br>
                    the sunlight filtering through the branches,<br>
                    their books open before them.</p>

                    <p>“You’ve got this,” Kavya would say,<br>
                    her voice full of certainty.</p>

                    <p>Slowly, Aarav began to believe it too.</p>

                    <p><b>A New Opportunity</b></p>

                    <p>One afternoon, Shyamlal Sir entered the classroom<br>
                    holding a notice in his hand.</p>

                    <p>“Students,” he announced,<br>
                    “There will be a state-level scholarship exam next month.<br>
                    The top-performing students will receive financial support<br>
                    and a chance to join summer training programs.”</p>

                    <p>The moment the words left his mouth,<br>
                    Aarav felt a jolt inside him.<br>
                    A new challenge.<br>
                    A new opportunity.</p>

                    <p>Kavya looked at him, eyes sparkling.<br>
                    “Aarav… we should go for this.”</p>

                    <p>He hesitated.<br>
                    The competition was much bigger than the district-level one.<br>
                    But something in his heart whispered,<br>
                    “Yes. You can do this.”</p>

                    <p><b>The Preparation Phase</b></p>

                    <p>This exam was tougher —<br>
                    math puzzles, logical reasoning, science application,<br>
                    and complex comprehension passages.</p>

                    <p>But Aarav did not back down.</p>

                    <p>He made a timetable.<br>
                    Woke up earlier than ever.<br>
                    Studied during lunch breaks.<br>
                    Reduced his playtime.<br>
                    And even stayed awake late on some nights,<br>
                    his lamp flickering while the rest of the house slept.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes he felt tired,<br>
                    sometimes frustrated,<br>
                    but he never stopped.</p>

                    <p>Kavya was always there —<br>
                    explaining tricky questions,<br>
                    motivating him,<br>
                    and challenging him to think deeper.</p>

                    <p><b>A Moment of Doubt</b></p>

                    <p>But even with all this effort,<br>
                    doubt found its way back into Aarav’s mind.</p>

                    <p>One evening, while solving a difficult reasoning problem,<br>
                    he suddenly threw the pencil aside.</p>

                    <p>“I can’t do this,” he said,<br>
                    his voice breaking.</p>

                    <p>Kavya looked at him calmly.<br>
                    “Yes, you can. You’ve already come so far.”</p>

                    <p>“No,” Aarav said softly,<br>
                    “I’m scared I’ll fail again.”</p>

                    <p>Kavya didn’t argue.<br>
                    She simply closed the book and said,<br>
                    “Come with me.”</p>

                    <p>She led him to the riverbank<br>
                    where the water shimmered under the orange sky.</p>

                    <p>“Aarav,” she said quietly,<br>
                    “You think failure makes you weak.<br>
                    But it actually made you stronger.<br>
                    You came back from something most people never recover from.”</p>

                    <p>She looked directly into his eyes.<br>
                    “I believe in you more than you believe in yourself.”</p>

                    <p>Aarav felt those words settle inside him<br>
                    like warm light pushing away the darkness.</p>

                    <p>He picked up the pencil again.</p>

                    <p><b>The Promise</b></p>

                    <p>From that day onward,<br>
                    Aarav made himself a silent promise:</p>

                    <p>“No matter what happens,<br>
                    I will not quit.”</p>

                    <p>With renewed determination,<br>
                    he studied harder than ever.<br>
                    Every chapter he mastered felt like a victory.<br>
                    Every problem he solved boosted his confidence.</p>

                    <p>Even Shyamlal Sir noticed.</p>

                    <p>“One day,” the teacher said,<br>
                    “you will go much farther than you think, Aarav.”</p>

                    <p>Aarav bowed his head respectfully,<br>
                    but inside, a new fire blazed.</p>

                    <p><b>Chapter 4’s End</b></p>

                    <p>As the date of the scholarship exam approached,<br>
                    Aarav felt nervous —<br>
                    but this time, it was a different kind of nervousness.<br>
                    Not fear.<br>
                    Not doubt.</p>

                    <p>It was the nervous excitement<br>
                    of someone who knew he had worked hard,<br>
                    someone who was ready to fight,<br>
                    someone who was no longer afraid to dream.</p>

                    <p>And under the vast sky of his small village,<br>
                    Aarav prepared himself<br>
                    for the second big test of his life.</p>
